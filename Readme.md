# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
 This repository explores the Requirement Analysis phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Its purpose is to provide learners and practitioners with resources, examples, and exercises that highlight how requirements are gathered, analyzed, documented, and validated.

 # What is Requirement Analysis?
 Requirement Analysis is a foundational phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs, goals, and expectations of stakeholders are identified, documented, and validated. It ensures that everyone â€” from clients and users to developers and testers â€” has a shared understanding of what the software should achieve.

 # Importance in the SDLC
  Defines Project Scope: Requirement Analysis clearly outlines the boundaries of the system, helping teams focus on essential features and avoid unnecessary work.

Guides Design and Development: The requirements gathered act as a blueprint for system architecture, UI/UX design, and coding.

Prevents Scope Creep: By documenting and validating requirements early, teams reduce the risk of uncontrolled changes later in the project.

Improves Communication: Serves as a common language between technical teams, business stakeholders, and end users.

Ensures Quality: Well-defined functional and non-functional requirements help in building a product that is reliable, scalable, and aligned with user expectations.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
 Requirement Analysis is often called the backbone of software development, because it determines whether the final product truly meets user and business needs.

 # Key Reasons for Requirement Analysis
 ðŸ”¹  Prevents Misunderstandings
By gathering and validating requirements early, teams reduce the risk of building the wrong solution. Everyone â€” stakeholders, developers, testers â€” works from the same clear expectations.

ðŸ”¹ Saves Time and Resources 
Fixing mistakes later in development (or after release) is costly. A solid requirement analysis helps spot gaps and errors early, minimizing rework and keeping the project on budget and on schedule.

ðŸ”¹ Guides the Entire Development Process
Requirements act like a blueprint. They guide design decisions, coding tasks, testing criteria, and even deployment strategies, ensuring the project moves in the right direction from start to finish.


# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several structured activities that ensure software requirements are well understood, documented, and validated before development begins. The five key activities are: 

 ðŸ”¹ Requirement Gathering

 Collecting information from stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations.

Techniques include interviews, surveys, questionnaires, and observation.

ðŸ”¹ Requirement Elicitation

Digging deeper into stakeholder needs by refining and clarifying gathered requirements.

Often involves brainstorming sessions, workshops, prototyping, and use case analysis.

ðŸ”¹ Requirement Documentation

Recording requirements in a clear and organized format for easy reference.

Common artifacts include Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), use cases, and user stories.

ðŸ”¹ Requirement Analysis and Modeling

Analyzing requirements for feasibility, consistency, and completeness.

Creating visual models (e.g., use case diagrams, data flow diagrams) to better understand system interactions.

ðŸ”¹ Requirement Validation

Reviewing documented requirements with stakeholders to confirm accuracy and alignment with business goals.

Ensures that requirements are realistic, testable, and agreed upon before development.


# Types of Requirements
ðŸ”¹ Functional Requirements
Define what the system should do.
Describe the features, functions, and interactions users can perform.

Examples: User login and registration. Searching and booking a property. Generating reports.

ðŸ”¹ Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs):
Define how the system should perform.
Focus on quality attributes such as performance, security, scalability, and usability.

Examples: Page load time under 2 seconds. 
System should support up to 10,000 concurrent users.
Data must be encrypted during transmission.

# Why Both Matter

Functional requirements ensure the system works as intended, while non-functional requirements ensure the system works well under real-world conditions. Together, they create software that is both useful and reliable.

# Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams are a visual representation of how different users (actors) interact with a system. They help illustrate the systemâ€™s functionality from the userâ€™s perspective and clarify the boundaries of the system.

# Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

Improves communication between stakeholders, developers, and designers by providing a simple and clear visual of the systemâ€™s interactions.

Helps identify requirements by focusing on what the users need to achieve.

Simplifies complexity by breaking down the system into smaller, user-oriented tasks.

Acts as documentation for understanding system scope and features.
